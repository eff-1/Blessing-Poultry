# DECORATIVE/PATTERN IMAGES

Put decorative elements and patterns here. These are optional but add visual interest.

## Optional Images (5-10 images):

1. **egg-pattern.png** - Egg texture or pattern (transparent PNG)
2. **organic-shape-1.svg** - Organic/amoeba shape for navbar
3. **organic-shape-2.svg** - Another organic shape
4. **feather-pattern.png** - Feather texture
5. **nature-bg.jpg** - Natural/green background
6. **texture-1.png** - Farm-related texture
7. **wave-shape.svg** - Wave or organic divider shape

## Image Specs:
- Format: PNG (with transparency) or SVG
- Quality: Clean, simple designs
- File size: Under 100KB each

## Tips:
- These are OPTIONAL - not required to start
- Simple, subtle designs work best
- Should complement, not distract
- Organic, nature-inspired shapes
- Can be created later if needed

## Note:
If you don't have these, I'll create simple CSS-based shapes instead. Focus on the main product and hero images first!
